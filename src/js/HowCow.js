        <p>This is a world news feed. Give it a minute or two for items to be published.</p>
                    
        <p>It's very easy to search or filter by typing in the box. Instant actually. If you want to keep it,
        just hit enter and the term will be added to a tag list. You can stack filter tags on top of each other.</p>
          
        <ul className="tutTags">
          <li className="tagItem tagInclude"><button type="button">Highland Cows</button></li>          
          <li className="tagItem tagInclude"><button type="button">Mountain Goats</button></li>          
        </ul>

        <p>As an extra, place a dash (-) at the beginning of the term and you can choose what not to see.</p>
          
        <ul className="tutTags">
          <li className="tagItem tagExclude"><button type="button">Beef</button></li>          
        </ul>

        <p>Tags are colour coded, (blue for included, red for excluded) so you will know how the list is being filtered. If you want to remove it, just click
        it. It's like they were never there. Magic.</p>
              
        <p>Click the word 'Sources' (just above the cow) if you wish to see where the news comes from.</p>

        <p>Take your time, the news will keep coming even as you read this.</p>
      
        <h2 id="cowwhy">Why?</h2>
            
        <p>This feed is a little different. It is intended for slow movers and not those who find themselves in a hurry. It intentionally
        shows nothing when you load it, and from then it will only show news as it is published. It's about the
        present, at a speed you can work with.</p>

        <p>You cannot set the source of the news, but you can curate with broad, simple strokes by tagging.
        Searching is fast too.</p>
